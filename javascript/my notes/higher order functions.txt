HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS


1.array is giving task to foreach which is a highorder function this function will iterate over array items and will perform a specific task with each array items ,foreach will handover this task to a function which is passed in as a paramter to foreach.

2.Or we can say that foreach will only iterate over array items and task with every array items will be performed according to the defination of that function which is passed as a parameter to foreach.

3.The function which is passed to higher order function ex.foreach is called as a callback function .

4.HOF functions will take callback(arrow function as a argument) and will pass all the array items to that call back function to perform operations on every array items
